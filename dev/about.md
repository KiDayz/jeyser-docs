# Jeyser CRM

Jeyser CRM is an open-source ERP/CRM for Junior-Enterprise.<br/><br/>

It has been started in 2013 by M-Gate, the Junior-Enterprise of Mines de Saint-Etienne. 

In 2015, the project has been revived by N7 Consulting. 
Since then both Junior-Entreprises collaborate on one unique version to share it with the others.

With the creation of the Docker installation method, it is extremely easy to get a secured installation of Jeyser.
And every Junior-Entreprise from an engineering school with computer science courses can easily join the Jeyser CRM project.
<br /><br/>

We truly believe that the only way to ensure a long term support is to go beyond single Junior-Entreprises, 
to share our know-how, so at every moment, at least one Junior-Entreprises maintains the project for all the others.
It already happened in 2015 when N7 Consulting revived Incipio when the first developers from M-Gate left the project.
