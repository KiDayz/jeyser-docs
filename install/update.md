# Update Jeyser

Contrary to some commercial products, Jeyser has an active community and receives bug fix and improvements. 
Thus it has to be updated regularly. 

When an admin connects, Jeyser displays on the welcome page if a new update is available. Just click the link and follow the instructions. 
Our update instructions are targeted for the docker installation. Thus if you have installed Jeyser with Docker, just connect to your server and copy paste the migration script in your shell.

**Beware** Don't copy paste the whole block. Do it line after line, otherwise it might not work (for instance if a command requires a validation or a manual input).
 

If you have a manual installation, the migration process is not much different, adapt . If you choosed the manual install, it should not be a big deal for you anyway.


It's important to update as soon as possible, in order not to miss an update.
Follow carefully the instructions. If you realized you missed an update, don't jump a version, do it step after step.

> Example:
>
> You are using Jeyser 2.2.0. Jeyser 2.2.1 is released but you miss it and when you want to update, Jeyser 2.3.0 is already out.
>
> ~~Don't~~: Follow the instructions to update from 2.2.1 to 2.3.0. It might not work and potentially break your Jeyser.
>
> **Do**: Follow the instructions to update from 2.2.0 to 2.2.1, and then follow those to update from 2.2.1 to 2.3.0

Remember, you are not alone, we are a community. If you have an issue with an update reach us out
