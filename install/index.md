<br/>If you have no server management skills, please read [Environment](environment) for some basics about it. don't be afraid, it's easy.

## TL;DR

## Server requirements

To run Jeyser you need a VPS (virtual private server) matching at least the following requirements : 

 - 1 vCPU
 - 2 GB of RAM
 - 10 Go of hard disk space
 
We strongly advocates for Ubuntu 18.04 (Ubuntu 16.04 is also supposed to work) as your server Operating System because our automatic install scripts 
are only tested on Ubuntu.

Such server cost between 3 and 7 euros per month.

 > At N7 Consulting we use an OVH VPS SSD1 at 3â‚¬/month and it works very well.
 
 In addition of your VPS, you will also need a subdomain pointing on your server ip. 
 More information in the [Environment](environment) setup guide.
 
## Install Jeyser using the Docker install

### Introduction

Docker is a virtualization system that isolates applications into containers. If you don't get that definition, don't worry. 
As for us, we use it to have a standard environment.
 
<br/>Using the docker install has many benefits : Automatic install, automatic and free SSL certificate (https),
 already configured server and software. **It is the best for non tech people.** 
 
In the following steps, we assume that your server will be used to run only Jeyser. 
If it is not the case, please refer to the [FAQ](dev/faq)
 
We can't make installation easier than that. Feel free to [ask for help if you need some](./../../support).
 
### Install script

Once a subdomain is pointing on your server ip and you connected to your server, copy paste the lines of the Jeyser installation script above in your console.


That's all ! Jeyser is now installing itself. Don't be afraid, it can take some time. 
At the end of the installation process, if go to the [configured subdomain](environment) (first connection can take several seconds) 
you should have a working login page. 
Connect with the credentials `admin/admin` and don't forget to change them right after your first login.
